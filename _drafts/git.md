Today, I pushed my 1000th commit to Github exactly one year from when I pushed my first commit to Github. Its kind of like an exciting thing in itself. Well, this was such a terrific year in itself, I still remember pushing my first commit to apsdehal/RD for Roorkee Delivers (a startup for which I made my first website), through Windows Github software :). I had awful exprience while doing this, as git is totally a blast for a newcomer, everything goes above the head in a single blow.

Ask me now, life without Git and Github is just unimaginable. Git has saved me an awful no. of times throughout all my experience of software development. IMO, git is a totally worth a shot to give at. Learn it, and you can take your skills to a whole new level. Reminding of Git, I remember I was targeting towards getting GSoC and SDSLabs last year, when I came to talk to Abhishek Das and he told me that first thing to learn is Git, I got somewhat into it, but not fully. It was time in winter vacations when I started contributing to MediaWiki and Moodle that I took Git to all new levels. The best teacher for you is you. Even though former goes great everywhere, but in this case its just necessary. 

Check out Stack Overflow when you are in any kind of problem. The first video that truly gave me some understanding about Git in 60 minutes by Scott Chacon (guy is really great), also checkout his book about git, thats awesome too.

So let me get you straight through some basics of Git so that I can really make this post somewhat useful for those who are reading it till now.

###What is Git?

> Git is a version control software

Ok, let me explain this in the layman language. Ever seen the windows different vesions like 7 and 8, just imagine that Git helps you having a control on different vesions like these for a software. Git helps you easily switch back and forth between them, make changes, even switch between these changes. Just for a better scene, think of Git as a camera that takes a snapshot of how your code looks like for the moment when you call a certain command, and that you can easily switch back and check this snapshot when ever you want.

###What is Github?

> GitHub is the best place to build software together

Ok, we just talk about snapshots via Git, just wonder now that you can share these snapshots with otehr people, cool it would be. Now these people whom with you are sharing are called collaborators can make their own changes and then take snapshots and again share it with you. This way people can code together and make great software. Now Github is the website where you can share all these snapshots, add collaborators, issues and much more.

###What is a commit?

> Commit is a snapshot or a version of your code
