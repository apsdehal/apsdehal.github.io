On April 21st, 2014. I was selected as a successful participant to Google Summer of Code, 2014. For those who don't know, Google Summer of Code is an annual internship ran by Google in which students participate to contribute to some selected open source projects, for which they are funded a handsome amount by Google. This year's stipend was $5500.

In this post, I am going to share my experience based on GSoC selection.<br/>
Majorily selection period revolves around mainly two stages:

- Pre-proposal period or brooding period
- Proposal period

You should concentrate on both these periods if you want to be a successful GSoC participant.
