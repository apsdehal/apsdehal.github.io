As I sit on the first bench of the class,<br/>
Thinking of the Senate and its grass.

Those were the days great,<br/>
I used to sit on last bench with eyes under the sleep's weight.

All the girls were visible,<br/>
and the friends approachable.

Cursed by this lecturer, I have been made to sit here,<br/>
from where I can see till nowhere.

On the other side, going on is the myth of electronics,<br/>
To understand this, I need tonics.

Time is passing away slowly away,<br/>
Too slow, a single minute has become a day.

Remembering the days two years back,<br/>
We were roaming in the hell like jack.

Now we are here in this great institute,<br/>
Always copying the tute.

Whether its lecture, tute or practical,<br/>
Our body is only present here, not our mind.

On the board, are going out and in the numerical<br/>
And we are saying "What the hell?"

See through, look forward and understand the feelings of Roll No. 92<br/>
His career and future in danger as he comes in the eyes of 'Majnu'.

Save us, hear our ache,<br/>
We are the IITians attending the lectures empty stomache.
