Don't know, how to show,

How much I love you, my friend true,

In the end of day,

It closes with remembering you away.

Hoping you are with me always,We sit together in moonlight and sunrays,

I feel like you are missing,

Want a hold and tight kissing,

Now the night has fallen on,

Thinking of you sleep has gone.

Now if the sleep will come,

It will be filled with your dreams of fun.
