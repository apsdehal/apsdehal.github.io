One day she entered her home, she couldn’t believe her eyes, that there was a cute child weeping on the floor. Her husband was impotent so there couldn’t, there never was a child. On asking the child his name biggest shock hit Miss Malhotra. He was her husband, it could be confirmed with his identity, eyebrows, face everything. How could this be possible, love and affection feelings towards the child demanded the answers. Her husband was a scientist so he used to do unusual things. She remembered that he was working on the time machine. One click, everything puzzled was simplified.
