I am the one who makes you cry,<br/>
See now there are tears in my eyes.<br/>
I know I am bad, I make you sad.<br/>
But you don’t know how much I am glad that you are in my life,<br/>
I am mad,<br/>
Baby, I am really sorry.<br/>
Tears fall on this paper as I write this,<br/>
Emotions are heavy on my heart<br/>
I am dying, tick by tick.<br/>
If you can listen me, as I call your name.<br/>
Please forgive me, I am too shameful.<br/>
Please, please, please Maam.<br/>

You are too good for me,<br/>
I don’t deserve you.<br/>
How can I be so lucky,<br/>
That I reserve you.<br/>
Tears are falling continuously, they don’t stop.<br/>
Paper tears with tears.<br/>
You are so noble, so pure hearted, that you love me,<br/>
I don’t know how can I explain, the situation upon me.<br/>
I like your soul, don’t hate me,<br/>
You are perfect all over from face to feet.<br/>

Maybe this doesn’t seems to be a poem,<br/>
This is love and pain, I bear in my heart.<br/>
I want to throw this pain away and love you till I die.<br/>
Hope I die soon and get to see you as a soul, always watch you,<br/>
there I lie.<br/>
Kill me but don’t hate me or think I don’t love you.<br/>
My condition is so worse, I try to find you in every other face.<br/>
I feel you,<br/>
I touch you,<br/>
I see you,<br/>
I dream you,<br/>
I live you,<br/>
I love you.<br/>
You are the one  who supports me in every situation,<br/>
You bring me up as a baby, You care for me.<br/>
I love you that’s all I know.<br/>
