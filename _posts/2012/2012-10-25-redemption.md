A beating heart, in furious rhythm<br/>
burns with a darkened knowledge,<br/>
of something that dims the soul,<br/>
and the spirit as well<br/>

What is it that dogs a man<br/>
and offers no relief,<br/>
what is it, he asks,<br/>
knowing full well

A line is crossed, immorally so<br/>
and with it comes the price to pay<br/>
in currency of little value,<br/>
but to you, and to me

Why does the active mind<br/>
cast a shroud upon the pain,<br/>
felt in the heat of day,<br/>
and in the dark of night

Wherever I travel, my companion goes,<br/>
unwelcome, but still there<br/>
beside me, within me,<br/>
advising me to care

Turning my head, shunning all calls<br/>
never alone, never at peace,<br/>
who is this persistent rider<br/>
tugging at my sleeves

When finally to home, searching<br/>
for the elusive balm<br/>
to calm the aches, and the strains,<br/>
though more is surely to come

Humbling oneself is not the joy,<br/>
nor the way for men to go<br/>
but, 'tis the only way<br/>
for a man to show

He understands the pain caused,<br/>
his realization is quite clear,<br/>
with head held high, and eyes,<br/>
that look upon the scene<br/>
unfolding in the presence,<br/>
of the one he loves the most,<br/>
to say simply, I am sorry,<br/>
for the pain I have caused<br/>
to one who knows me well,<br/>
not once did you doubt me,<br/>
though the reasons were near,<br/>
for the gift you offer is priceless<br/>
that which may not be denied,<br/>
I am truly sorry, I deserve the worst,<br/>
yet, you give the gift of redemption,<br/>
once more, may I live
