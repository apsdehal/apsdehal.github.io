Remembering the past still makes me shiver,<br/>
How passed away through, no matter of time,<br/>
I don’t know, I was flowing across which river,

The pain, harshness those sweats were great.<br/>
But they made me change and turned me strong,<br/>
Now the symptoms are appearing again,<br/>
They frighten me, tell me where I wrong.

Fears grip me, they are taking me inside them,<br/>
I am not a gem, leave me alone.<br/>
Don’t want desperation again, No repeat of shame,

Symptoms are clear, its all part of a mind game,<br/>
They are taking over me, pulling in dark,<br/>
They are calling, leaving a mark.

Now its time to remove the mask,<br/>
I have to move with them to do the task.<br/>
I can feel the cold, I can feel the goosebumps,<br/>
I have to go with them, to feel the jumps…..
